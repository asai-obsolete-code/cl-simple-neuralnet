neural network class. Slot @code{nodes} (with accessor NODES-OF) is a vector
 array which contains the number of nodes in each layer, in the same order as
the forward propagation. slot @code{w}, with accessor @code{weight-of}, holds the weight
 which will be used in the propagation and modified in the back-propagation.
